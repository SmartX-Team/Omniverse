# Intro
Hi!

This extension was created by the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST) [^1] to faccilitate a 
myriad of diffrent functions sourounding the UGV Husky [^2] created by Clearpath Robotics for the intendet usage in 
tandem with Issac Sim [^3] by Nvidia and the Robot Operating System 2 Humble [^4] (from now on referred as ROS 2 or
Humble).

This extension encompasses:
- Features for setting up Husky in Isaac Sim to be as realistic as possible
- Driving Husky in Isaac Sim as well in the real world
- Enabling connections between various diffrent parts of the ecosystem "Husky"
- An additonal 4 standalone scripts used for:
    - Steering and controlling Husky via a virtual Tank Controller called COSMO
    - Adjusting the velocity of all 4 wheels at the same time via a virtual joystick
    - and two scripts for saving and reading data to and from Kafka for data storage

The following image is an explenation of the system architecture:

(All of the dotted lines are showing connections that have not yet been connected, but are in the planning.)

    - pygame: `pip install pygame==2.6.0`
    - kafka: `pip3 uninstall kafka && pip3 install kafka-python`
If you are using windows please download this library on your local WSL2 installation.

Now you should have all neccessary downloads to start up this extension! `:)`

## Seting up the Extension
To set up the extension, after everything has been installed you need to open up Isaac Sim with the ROS2 Bridge enabled.

Afterwards go into: Windows -> Extensions -> Humburger Symbol (☰) -> Settings -> Extension Search Path
When opeing up the extension search path tab, please click on the plus button in the edit column.

1. Use the github link:
Then copy this link for the current extension: `git://github.com/SmartX-Team/Omniverse.git?branch=backend&dir=[GISTAI]NiKI_Test_Ros/exts`
And that paste it into the now new empty column.
> This hot reloads every time the github gets updated.

2. Use the files:
Download the complete 'exts'-folder into a folder on your localhost or server. 
(You can use services as [GitDown]("https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home") for this purpose.)
Then copy the path to the 'exts'-folder and paste it into the now new empty column.
> This hot reloads every time your local extension gets updated.

Finally, look for "ni.ki.test.ros" extension in extension manager and enable it, it should be in the tap for third parties.

Done.

Now you can use this extension!
